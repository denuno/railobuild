USAGE

BUILDING

Some notes about building:

	Building *will* take a while, the first time, as it pulls the  Git repo.
	Subsequent builds are fast as fast can be ish!
	
	You can specify the Git repo to pull from by editing the build/src.xml file.
	
	As the Railo repo is imported into the ./src directory, any git operations
	for the sources should be done there.

	Different versions of Railo require different Java versions to compile. If 
	you try to build with the wrong version of Java, the build will fail and 
	tell you what the correct version to use is.  If you are on linux/OS X, 
	you can pass in the location of JAVA_HOME via build.java.home
	
	ex: ./railobuild build branch=3.2.1.006 build.java.home=/path/to/java_home
	
	Using the "build" or "commit" build options will do a *forced* checkout of
	the corresponding sources.  If you have any changes, you sure as hell have
	better committed them before running these "distructive" builds.
	
	Running a plain "build", without the branch or commit options, will only run
	the build on the current sources.
	
	The sources are compiled with the Eclipse ECJ compiler, so no JDK is needed.

Build the default (3.3) branch

 ./railobuild build 

Build the "develop" branch

 ./railobuild build branch=develop
 
Build a tag (uses the branch argument but specify the tag)

 ./railobuild build branch=3.3.1.006
 
Build a random commit 
 
 ./railobuild build commit=81a8897d1b9e273f8de819eb56a13d7bcf5d51cf


TESTING

Some notes on testing:

	The tests are stored with the railobuild project, so you can change the
	the version of Railo you are testing with, without having to commit the
	tests to that branch.  We should probably create a separate repository for
	all tests, and pull from that.  We should probably categorize things like
	web/server admin tests by Railo version, so we can not run the new admin 
	features on the old admin versions.
	
	tests/
		/jira  (jira tests)
		/jmeter (jmeter tests)
		/results (generic test results dir)
		/results/jmeter (jmeter results)

Build and run the jira tests:
 ./railobuild build.and.test

Run the jira tests:
 ./railobuild test

LOAD TESTS:  JMETER

Downlaod and install JMeter (defaults to ./build/jmeter-{version}) by entering: 
 ./railobuild jmeter.install

Build and run the jmeter tests:
 ./railobuild build.and.loadtest

Run the jmeter tests (this will run jmeter.run and jmeter.report):
 ./railobuild loadtest

Run the jmeter tests alone (no report generation):
 ./railobuild jmeter.run

Run the jmeter report generation (no tests are run):
 ./railobuild jmeter.report

Clean the jmeter test results and reports:
 ./railobuild jmeter.clean

To run the test server by hand in the foreground (does not background):
 ./railobuild server.start.fg

Starting the test server by hand (goes to background):
 ./railobuild server.start

Stopping the test server by hand:
 ./railobuild server.stop

Editing JMeter tests:
 ./railobuild server.start
 ./build/jmeter-2.6.1/bin/jmeter.sh

do yer editing or whatever, then
 ./railobuild server.stop

PACKAGING

WAR
	A WAR file is generated as part of the standard build, as is the railo.jar,
	and core.rc file.
